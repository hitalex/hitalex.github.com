下面是《[傲慢与偏见](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1418200/)》中Mr Collins向Lizzie求婚时的台词。其实词倒是很好，只是人差了点，请欣赏！

*Mr Collins*: Dear Miss Elizabeth, my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with my feelings, perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying. 

Firstly, that is the duty of a clergyman (神职人员) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

Secondly, I am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness.

And thirdly, that it is at the urging  of my esteemed patroness(资助人), Lady Catherine, that I select a wife.

My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from among Mr Bennet's daughters, for I am to inherit the estate and such an alliance will surely suit everyone.

And now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections.

*Miss Lizzie*: Mr Collins!

*Mr Collins*: And no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we're married.

*Miss Lizzie*: You forget I have given no answer.

*Mr Collins*:Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.

*Miss Lizzie*: Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but I regret that I must decline it.

*Mr Collins*: I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

*Miss Lizzie*: Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy. And I am convinced that I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.

*Mr Collins*: I flatter myself that your refusal is merely a nature delicacy. Besides, despite manifold(各种各样的) attractions, it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you. 

So I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.

*Miss Lizzie*: Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment(折磨) a respectable man. Please understand me, I can't accept you.（Miss Lizzie 跑出屋子，她母亲推门而入。）

*Mrs Bennet*: Headstrong, foolish child!
